[Prompt for ChatGPT]
-Can you please make a bash script to use on linux mint to do the following things when I run it?
-You may ask my as many questions you want so that the instructions are clear to you so that you may help me with this and do the necessary.


[Instructions]
-Disable repository restrictions with the help of this by adding "#" to the second line of code:
"sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list"

-Run this command:
"sudo apt update"

-Install every .deb file from the following location:
"/home/mint/Downloads/Linux Customization/AppImages & .deb files/Debs"

-Run the following command: 
"sudo apt install chafa imagemagick jp2a cool-retro-term lxappearance diodon"

-Install conky and conky manager2 with the help of these commands:
"sudo add-apt-repository ppa:teejee2008/foss"
"sudo apt update"
"sudo apt install conky-manager2"
(If conky is not installed using the above commands, install it using this deb file: "/$HOME/Downloads/Linux Customization/AppImages & .deb files/Optional Debs/conky-manager2_2.72_amd64.deb")
(Add a fallback option when installing conky, if the PPAs aren't working, install from the provided deb file instead)

-Ask before installing.
-Run this command to install ohmyposh:
"curl -s https://ohmyposh.dev/install.sh | bash -s"


[This applies to everything]-"Important"
-Check if the packages were previously installed.
-Skip any and all installed packages
-Install and update the packages as necessary
-Skip any step that has been previously completed.
-All the steps are to be done in order typed, nothing is to be done before the other
-Everything is for the current user.
-Please label everthing to make it easier to edit the bash file.
-Remove the cloned GitHub folders after installation is complete.
-Leave the "/home/mint/Downloads/Linux Customization" folder as is.
-Everything is to have a fallback option back to their .deb files.
