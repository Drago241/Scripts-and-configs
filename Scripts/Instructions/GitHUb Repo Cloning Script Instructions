Run:
"sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list"

Make a bash script that clones any github repositiry and installs it, provided that I give a link.

The cloned repository is to be deleted afterwards.

Check before installing any dependency or application, if something is already installed or if any dependency is present, it is to be skipped.

Install git only if required.

[This applies to everything]-"Important"
-Check if the packages were previously installed.
-Ask before installing/updating/removing anything.
-Skip any and all installed packages
-Install and update the packages as necessary
-Skip any step that has been previously completed. (Do ask for the confirmation if it is to be skipped or not)
-"Ask all the questions at the very start of the script."
-All the steps are to be done in order typed, nothing is to be done before the other
-Everything is for the current user.
-Please label everthing to make it easier to edit the bash file.
-Once everything is done, please clean and remove all the unused and unnecessary packages after confirming to do so.
-Remove the cloned GitHub folders after installation is complete.
-Create a set-up and revert script in a single file.
