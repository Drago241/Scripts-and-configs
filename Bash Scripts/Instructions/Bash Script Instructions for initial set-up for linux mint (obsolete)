[Prompt for ChatGPT]
-Can you please make a bash script to use on linux mint to do the following things when I run it?
-You may ask my as many questions you want so that the instructions are clear to you so that you may help me with this and do the necessary.


[Instructions]
-Disable repository restrictions with the help of this by adding "#" to the second line of code:
"sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list"

-Run this command:
"sudo apt update"

-Install every .deb file from the following location:
"/home/mint/Downloads/System Customization/AppImages & .deb files"

-Ask if I want to install the following deb files:
"/home/mint/Downloads/System Customization/AppImages & .deb files/Optional Debs/jp2a_1.1.1-2ubuntu2_amd64.deb"
"/home/mint/Downloads/System Customization/AppImages & .deb files/Optional Debs/imagemagick_6.9.12.98+dfsg1-5.2build2_amd64.deb"

-Ask if I want to install chafa, then run the following command:
sudo apt install chafa
(along with all its dependencies)

-Install conky and conky manager2 with the help of these commands:
"sudo add-apt-repository ppa:teejee2008/foss"
"sudo apt update"
"sudo apt install conky-manager2"
(If conky is not installed using the above commands, install it using this deb file: "/home/mint/Downloads/System Customization/AppImages & .deb files/Optional Debs/conky-manager2_2.72_amd64.deb")
(Add a fallback option when installing conky, if the PPAs aren't working, install from the provided deb file instead)

-Ask before installing.
-Run this command to install ohmyposh:
"curl -s https://ohmyposh.dev/install.sh | bash -s"


[This applies to everything]-"Important"
-Ask everything at the start of the script.
-Check if the packages were previously installed.
-Ask before installing/updating/removing anything.
-Skip any and all installed packages
-Install and update the packages as necessary
-Skip any step that has been previously completed. (Do ask for the confirmation if it is to be skipped or not)
-"Ask all the questions at the very start of the script."
-All the steps are to be done in order typed, nothing is to be done before the other
-Everything is for the current user.
-Please label everthing to make it easier to edit the bash file.
-Once everything is done, please clean and remove all the unused and unnecessary packages after confirming to do so.
-Remove the cloned GitHub folders after installation is complete.
-Add descriptions to everything to make the script easier to understand.

[Questions]
User and home directory:
You’ve mentioned /home/mint/… in all paths. Should the script work only for the current logged-in user (using $HOME) or always assume the user mint? Using $HOME is safer for general use.
-Current logged in user.

Should each action have a yes/no prompt or should it be one big menu at the start asking for all actions at once?
-One big menu at the start asking for all the actions at once.

If a folder with the same name exists in ~/.conky, should it overwrite or skip?
-It shouldn't exist, but if it does then ask before performing an action.

Fonts and wallpapers:
For fonts: Should it skip already existing fonts or overwrite them?
-Skip existing fonts.

For wallpapers: You want to copy to Downloads, but if a file already exists, overwrite or skip?
-It shouldn't exist, but if it does then ask before performing an action.

Oh My Posh install:
Do you want to check if it’s installed first, or just run the installation script always?
-Check before installation.

For conky-manager2, same question: install latest from PPA or skip if installed?
--Latest, but skip if the latest is installed.

Colored logging: Do you want colored, timestamped output for all actions (install, copy, remove), or just plain logging?
-Coloured, timestamped output.

Conky folders overwrite check: If a folder like BG-main already exists in ~/.conky, should the script ask before overwriting, or just overwrite automatically?
-Overwrite automatically.
